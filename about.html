                            Together with the Liter of Light NGO I was able to spend a week disconnected from the world at a Quilombola community in Brazil: the Kalungas. Over a hundred years ago, escaped African slaves used to run away from the farms they were being kept to remote places in the heart of Brazil where they wouldn't be found and could live in peace. This escaped slaves formed Quilombola communities all over Brazil, the biggest of them being the Kalungas. Slavery ended, but the communities remained, many of them still lacking some basic infrastructure. So we went there to give out some light, but it turns out that we were the ones touched by the light of those amazing people and their traditions. Hopefully, we could make as much of a difference in their lives as they made in ours.

                            Now I'm a professor (or a teaching intern). I'm helped out in the Dynamical control classes lectured by my advisor at UnB, besides aiding him with tests and exercises I'm also helped out by actually teaching the classes on the subject of space state control! It was a great experience, just makes me more certain of what I want to keep doing.

                            Last September I came back home to finish my masters. I was happy to be able to accomplish so many things since then. In particular, I could submit a paper to 2019 IEEE International Conference on Robotic Computing and I'm currently working on some demos using the physical platforms. Also, I hope to be able to submit another paper soon with some extensions to my results so far :)

                            This year I was one of three women awarded a grant by the NCCR Robotics consortium to spend six months doing research in Switzerland. My time there was spent at the Professor's Auke Ijspeert BioRob Laboratory where I could learn a lot and contribute with a Demo at the end of the project.

                             This was the first major international conference I was able to both go and do an oral presentation! Not only the conference was on the beautiful Big Island of Hawaii, but also there were so many incredible people doing incredible work there! The experience of going to the panels and talking to the researchers was incredible, and more than that, I receive so much positive feedback, that I went home full of ideas about the future!

                              The UnBeatables team became an outreach activity! It took us long enough to realize that the NAO robot was perfect to teach and entertain kids, but in September 2015 we finally moved to this direction. We started our monthly visits to children's hospitals and schools, and it was always a great success.

                              For my first international robotics event, I travelled all the way to the other side of the world to compete at the RoboCup 2015 in Hefei-China. It was incredible, I learned so much and met so many people. I frankly, I had never seen so many robots together in my life! We played in the Standard(SPL) with the NAO robot, in the Drop-In Only category (we just put one robot in the field, and it should be able to play with other team's robots - we were evaluated by performance). We were very excited and nervous (especially me, working as a student team leader), but had an amazing experience! And we were awarded best player in our category!

                              We travelled to São Carlos to participate in our first Latin American Robotics Competition. It was amazing to be part of a robotics competition. I learned so much and slept so little, and yet, It was fantastic! Plus, It was the first time there was a robot football competition in Brazil! We were awarded the first place for the newly invented SPL category there.
